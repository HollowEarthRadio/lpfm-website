              We are so excited for what will be the 7th annual Magma Festival! As an extension of Hollow Earth Radioâ€™s mission to provide a forum for underrepresented sounds and perspectives, we put on this month-long festival to highlight our favorite artists and musicians! Magma Festival is an essential part of our core programming and has become a central component of what we do, while also working as a chance for the NW music community to show their support for the station. This year we are proud to present one of our most diverse lineups of artists yet!
              <br/><p/>
              <strong>Highlights include:</strong>
              <ul>
              <li>
An eccentric night of out of this world performance by the legendary SPACE LADY, remarkable outsider artist GENEVA JACUZZI, intuitive natural artist SHANNON NICOLE KRINGEN (Goddess Kring) and Portland artist SciFiSol.
              </li>
              <li>
An evening of various tones for MAGMA-tized headspace with true surround sound implications curated by Eiderdown Records featuring ECSTATIC COSMIC UNION, WALRUS MACHINE, STALE BIRTH and more!
              </li>
              <li>
Feminine soundscapes and absurd variety presented by the all female radio show Yonic BOOM! featuring the ethereal essence of KELLI FRANCES CORRADO, FINGER FANTASY (members of Black Queen and Sugar Skulls,) and the pent-up radical explosions of SEXES (feat. members of Witches Titties)
              </li>
              <li>
NW hard hitters HALF BREED, SO PITTED, HOT FRUIT, LURES, SCARVES, and PONYHOMIE

              </li>
              <li>
Spoken word performance, dance, a ton more!!
